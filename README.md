# PNR-Status
I have created the website for checking PNR status of railway ticket. This is the prototype of the checking PNR status. 

In PNR their are various types of reservation types viz. as follows-
  1. General Waiting List (GNWL)
  2. Remote Location Waiting List (RLWL)
  3. Pooled Quota Waiting List (PQWL)
  4. Remote Location General Waiting List (RLGN)
  5. Roadside Station Waiting List (RSWL)
  6. Request Waiting List (RQWL)
  7. Tatkal waiting list (TQWL)
  
  We have to select the type of tickets which we have taken., On that basis we have to proceed.
  
  For Proper Understanding visit the Project Website-'PNR STATUS.html'.
